        <p>This prototype includes all of the questions from the PROBE v 3 document, and the scoring questions stated in the legislation. It works though the initial questions, which are then checked and confirmed before the assessor can do the scoring (done after the claimant has left).</p>
       
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Research from Team Lime informed the choice of task lists for navigation, inline with GDS patterns. Left hand navigation was preferred by assessors however they also lost work because of the way it works, they were not realising the need to save answers. They could all use the task list without losing data, and no one had any problems with it. We think the task list is the viable choice for April, with the potential to further research and test left hand navigation if necessary for the future.</li>
            <li>All inputs during the assessment are free text, with the exception of those legislated for scoring. This will be iterated in the next iteration to break them down and give built in structure where needed, and generate better quality data in return.</li>
            <li>The guidance from the Probe document is shown underneath the free text fields.</li>
            <li>The notes taken with the claimant present are displayed back to the assessor while they do the scoring questions for reference.</li>
          </ul>
